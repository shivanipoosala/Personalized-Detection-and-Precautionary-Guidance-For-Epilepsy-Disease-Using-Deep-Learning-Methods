# Personalized-Detection-and-Precautionary-Guidance-For-Epilepsy-Disease-Using-Deep-Learning-Methods
# Epilepsy
Epilepsy may occur as a result of a genetic disorder or an acquired brain injury, such as a trauma or stroke. During a seizure, a person experiences abnormal behaviour, symptoms and sensations, sometimes including loss of consciousness. There are few symptoms between seizures. Epilepsy is usually treated by medication and in some cases by surgery, devices or dietary changes.

# Seizure
A seizure is a sudden surge of electrical activity in the brain. A seizure usually affects how a person appears or acts for a short time. Many different things can occur during a seizure. Whatever the brain and body can do normally can also occur during a seizure.

# Data Collection
By conducting survey we have collected data.

# Abstract
Tremor, a neurological condition, produces uncontrollable convulsions due to unusual brain activity, resulting in a variety of symptoms including convulsions, altered awareness, and behavioural changes. Researchers are working on algorithms to detect and forecast epileptic seizures by examining brain activity and extracting relevant information. This helps identify patterns related with seizures. Deep learning approaches improve standard generalist diagnosis by delivering individualized insight. By personalizing detection to each patient, this technique has the potential to improve epilepsy management and patient outcomes. In order to provide more individualized diagnosis and therapy, researchers are using algorithms that use brain activity analysis to identify and forecast epileptic seizures. Traditional diagnostic approaches are improved by deep learning algorithms, which offer personalized insights for every patient. Better patient outcomes could result from this tailored approach to epilepsy therapy, which has the potential to transform the field. In an effort to provide more individualized care, researchers are using algorithms to evaluate brain activity in order to detect and forecast epileptic seizures. Innovations in deep learning augment conventional approaches, offering personalized insights for every patient. With the potential to enhance patient outcomes, this personalized approach has the potential to revolutionize the therapy of epilepsy.

# Introduction
<li>Epilepsy is a condition where people have recurring seizures. Figuring out the best treatment can be tricky because it varies a lot from person to person. But now, new tech called deep learning can help by looking at brain images to find clues about each person's epilepsy.<br></li>
<li>Deep learning is like a super-smart computer program. It looks at lots of brain images and finds patterns that might show when a seizure could happen. This helps doctors make personalized plans for each person, like adjusting medicines or suggesting lifestyle changes to reduce seizures.<br></li>
<li>So, using deep learning with brain images can help doctors better understand and treat epilepsy in a way that fits each person's needs.<br></li>

# Problem Identification
-->Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain caused by repeated seizures. A seizure is usually defined as a sudden alteration of behavior due to a temporary change in the electrical functioning of the brain.<br>
-->Understanding epilepsy issues is crucial for improvement. Diagnosing and treating epilepsy can be tricky due to individual differences. Reliable seizure prediction tools are essential.<br> 
-->Beyond medical aspects, supporting individuals in all aspects of life is important. Disparities in access to assistance are unfair, and some may feel excluded due to epilepsy.<br>
-->Special attention is needed for the elderly and children with epilepsy. While using wearable technology is a good idea, caution is required. Collaboration among healthcare professionals, scientists, and advocates is necessary to enhance epilepsy care.<br>
-->To simplify the process, we've opted to develop a deep learning model capable of forecasting epilepsy occurrences in advance. This model will not only predict seizures but also provide personalized precautions and warnings to individuals, aiming to enhance their overall quality of life.<br>



# Objective of Problem
