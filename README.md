# Epilepsy
Epilepsy may occur as a result of a genetic disorder or an acquired brain injury, such as a trauma or stroke. During a seizure, a person experiences abnormal behaviour, symptoms and sensations, sometimes including loss of consciousness. There are few symptoms between seizures. Epilepsy is usually treated by medication and in some cases by surgery, devices or dietary changes.

# Seizure
A seizure is a sudden surge of electrical activity in the brain. A seizure usually affects how a person appears or acts for a short time. Many different things can occur during a seizure. Whatever the brain and body can do normally can also occur during a seizure.

# Abstract
Tremor is an neural illness identify by uncontrollable convulsions created by unusual electronic action in the cerebrum. Convulsions may occur in a variety of ways, including convulsions, loss of consciousness, and changing feelings and behaviors. Researchers have concentrated on algorithms that can help professionals detect and predict epileptic seizures. Machine learning plays a crucial role in this field, applying several algorithms for early Convulsion recognition and categorization. The extraction of important information from data related to brain activity. These characteristics aid in detecting the underlying patterns associated with epileptic convulsions. Machine learning classifiers, for example, are then used to evaluate and categorize the data based on these attributes. Both normal brain activity and epileptic seizures are possible. The study you referenced conducted a thorough review of the literature to find commonly used techniques for extracting characteristics and machine learning algorithms for effective diagnosis of normal versus convulsive brain activity. Data from reputable archives such as the Medical Devices and The IEEE Xplore, Wiley, Elsevier, the ACM, and Springer Publishers Link were analyzed for the study. Furthermore, the study created a classification of the most recent answers to this test, which includes a thorough examination of benchmark datasets and an unbiased assessment of classifier performance. Finally, the study showed gaps, problems, and opportunities in the area, providing insights that can be used to drive future research to improve epileptic Convulsion prediction and understanding.

# Introduction
Tremor is a common neural illness, if left untreated, can be dangerous. This disease effects humans in the length of their lifes. The complicated enzymatic transform occurs in the brain's sensory cell to cause a Convulsion. Those enzymatic transformations happen in sensory cells , which exist composed of cations and anions one produce electronic actions. Minor jerks to severe, widespread, and long-lasting seizures result from these sudden alterations. This neurological illness affects not only mobility but also bladder and intestinal function, as well as consciousness and mental ability. Epilepsy affects a large proportion of the population, with around 70% of those affected being adults and 30% being children. The etiology of epilepsy in approximately 70% of cases, whether in adults or children, remains elusive. When recurrent convulsions take place, they are clinically categorized as epilepsy. Seizures are broadly categorized into two main types: partial seizures, also referred to as focal seizures, and generalized convulsions. In the case of partial seizures, only a limited region of the brain is impacted, whereas epilepsy involves abnormal electrical activity affecting the entire brain. Early epileptic seizure prediction ensures plenty of time before the attack happens; it is extremely beneficial since treatment can prevent the attack. Preictal states precede seizures, ictal states start at seizure onset and end with an attack, postictal states follow ictal states, and interictal states follow postictal states of the first seizure and end prior to the onset of the preictal state of the subsequent seizure.

# Problem Statement
Millions of individuals worldwide suffer with epilepsy, a neurological condition marked by recurring seizures. The unpredictable nature of seizures is a substantial obstacle to the management of epilepsy, as it makes it challenging for individuals to adopt preventative measures. The goal of this project is to create an early warning system that uses machine learning algorithms to forecast and notify users of approaching epileptic episodes.

# Objective of Problem
Seizure Prediction & Warning : ML algorithm can analyze data & other relevant information to predict when a seizure is likely to occur. This can provide individuals with epilepsy and their caregivers with a warning, allowing them to take precautionary measures, such as moving to a safer location or taking medication, to minimize the impact of the seizure.<br>

Improved Quality of Life : Early prediction & warning can help individuals with epilepsy lead more normal lives. By avoiding seizures people with epilepsy can engage in daily activities,drive & work with greater independence.<br>

Reduced Hospitalizations : Early prediction can lead to reduced hospital admissions due to epilepsy-related seizures, which can lower healthcare costs and improve the overall health of patients.<br>

Personalized Care : ML models can be tailored to individual patients, taking into account their specific seizure patterns and triggers. This enables personalized care plans and interventions, which can be more effective in managing epilepsy.
